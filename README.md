Project: Global Food Production Analysis (1961–2023)  
This repository showcases an interactive Power BI report analyzing multi‑decade trends in global crop production, with visuals that highlight time‑series growth, regional segmentation, and commodity comparisons for decision‑makers and analysts.

Highlights  
- Trend analysis: Area charts track wheat, maize, and rice production from 1961–2023, revealing a steady rise and the strongest growth in wheat.  
- Comparative insights: Cards and gauges surface headline totals—Rice 269bn tonnes, Wheat 282bn tonnes, Tea 2bn tonnes—while bar charts rank fruits with grapes leading (~43bn) over apples, bananas, and oranges.  
- Regional segmentation: Coffee (green) production views show Africa leading, followed by Asia and the Americas, enabling geographic benchmarking and export potential assessment.  
- Annual patterns: A maize‑by‑year donut quickly identifies peak years and decade shifts to contextualize policy, climate, and technology impacts.

What’s inside  
- Power BI report file and screenshots demonstrating the dashboard layout, measures, and interactions across entities, regions, and years.  
- Project documentation summarizing objectives, design rationale, data modeling, and visualization choices for clarity and reproducibility.

Skills and tooling  
- Power BI, DAX, Power Query, data modeling, time‑series analysis, visual design, and stakeholder‑focused reporting.

How to use  
- Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop to explore pages with trend lines, comparative bars, gauges/cards, and interactive filters for entities and regions.  
- Use slicers to drill into commodities and geographies; consult the report notes for context on measures and transformations.

Outcomes  
- Communicates long‑term production growth and regional strengths to support discussions on food security and agricultural performance improvements.  
- Provides a reusable template for time‑series commodity analysis and comparative dashboards.

Internship context  
Completed during a Virtual Data Analyst (Power BI) Internship (23 Jun 2025 – 11 Aug 2025), demonstrating applied proficiency in end‑to‑end BI development.
